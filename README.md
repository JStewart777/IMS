Inventory Management System

Develop a business application, such as:
• Restaurant management system
• Online shop
• Core banking system
• A specific component of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system (i.e. sales, HR,
financial planning, inventory etc.)
• Library system
• Franchise management system
• Or any other business application of your choice
Requirements:
Your application should implement at least two end-to-end scenarios:
• A customer requests to open a new saving account -> account is opened
• A sales request is received by the sales system -> the request is fulfilled
• A customer requests membership at the local library -> membership is granted
• Or any other end-to-end scenario related to your business application
• A request for a new branch of your franchise -> granting the license
Your application should use all four of the data types we covered:
• Arrays
• ArrayLists
• HashMap
• HashSets
Your application should take advantage of these datatypes considering their strengths and
weaknesses for storing specific datasets.
Your application should:
• Implement the four principles of object-oriented programming
o Inheritance
o Polymorphism
o Encapsulation
o Abstraction
• Follow an object-oriented programing architecture, using java facilities to implement
the above principles. Facilities such as:
o Classes with accessors and mutators and private and public attributes and
methods
o Abstract classes and methods
o Super classes and sub classes
o Method overloading and overriding
o Interfaces
o Static data and methods
You need to think about different entities in your business problem and use the best OOP
architecture to model them. For example:
• In a library, you might have abstract (or super) classes such as book and shelf and rooms
and members and classes such as books of different genre or types, shelfts in different
sections (display, storage, etc), member groups (based on age, loyalty, etc.),
implementing them.
• In a franchise management system, you might have abstract (or super) classes such as
restaurants, employee, supplier, and interfaces such as brand and have classes such as
restaurants in different regions, employees in different roles, suppliers of different good
groups and etc implementing them.
Your application should take advantage of these facilities and use them in a logical and rational
way to enhance the reusability and configurability of your code while decreasing its complexity.
Deliverables:
You need to submit your code, but your score will be based on a presentation including the
below items:
1. (10 points – 1 minutes) Two flowcharts for the two end-to-end scenarios:
1.1. The scenarios need to be realistic, but does not have to be complicated. A typical
business scenario generally goes through 2-3 decision points and uses 2-3 data items
for making those decisions, and adds or changes 1-2 entities in the system.
1.2. For example, a request for an item from the inventory goes through inventory
employee who only checks the availability of the item, the inventory supervisor that
confirms the request, and the inventory employee who delivers the item and makes
changes to the availability of the item and to the storage space in the inventory.
2. (40 points – 2 minutes) A demo of the two scenarios.
3. (20 points – 1 minutes) A UML diagram of the system, including the class hierarchy, and the
data and behavior for each class.
4. (10 points – 2 minutes) Clear justification for the use of each of the four data types.
5. (10 points – 2 minutes) Defining each principle of object-oriented programming.
6. (10 points – 2 minutes) Showing how each principle is implemented in your code.
